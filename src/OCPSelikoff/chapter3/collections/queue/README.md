#Queue:

You use a queue when elements are added and removed in a specific order.
Queues are typically used for sorting elements prior to processing them.

FIFO (first-in, first-out)
LIFO (last-in, first-out.)

The main benefit of a LinkedList is that it implements both the List 
and Queue interfaces. It is a double-ended queue (is different from 
a regular queue in that you can insert and remove elements from both 
the front and back of the queue)

The difference between whether an ArrayDeque is being used as a stack 
or a queue is really important. To review, a queue is like a line 
of people. You get on in the back and off in the front. A stack is like 
a stack of plates. You put the plate on the top and take it off the top.

A LinkedList works the exact same way as ArrayDeque
