 * The first method is fine. In fact, it is equivalent to the Swan example. Goose extends
 * Bird. Since we are in the Goose subclass and referring to a Goose reference, it can access
 * protected members. The second method is a problem. Although the object happens to be
 * a Goose, it is stored in a Bird reference. We are not allowed to refer to members of the Bird
 * class since we are not in the same package and Bird is not a subclass of Bird.
