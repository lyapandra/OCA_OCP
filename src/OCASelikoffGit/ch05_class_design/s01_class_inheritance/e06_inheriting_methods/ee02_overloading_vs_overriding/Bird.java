 * Introducing Class Inheritance<br>
 * Calling Inherited Class Members - Inheriting Methods - Overriding a Method - Overloading vs. Overriding - pages 248-249
 * <p>
 * Overloading a method and overriding a method are similar in that they both involve
 * redefining a method using the same name. They differ in that an overloaded method will
 * use a different signature than an overridden method. This distinction allows overloaded
 * methods a great deal more freedom in syntax than an overridden method would have.
